# Liver-Disease-Prediction
This data is originally from the University of California Irvine machine learning dataset repository and is currently on Kaggle.

Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles, and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms to reduce burden on doctors. 

This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records. 

Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".
Below listed are the data columns that we have worked on.

Data columns:

Age of the patient

Gender of the patient 

Total Bilirubin 

Direct Bilirubin 

Alkaline Phosphotase 

Alamine Aminotransferase 

Aspartate Aminotransferase 

Total Protiens 

Using the indian_liver_patient dataset, we have performed a thorough analysis of the data which includes Correlation, Logit, Neural Network, XG gradient Boost and we have determined which model gives the best accuracy and helps us in predicting the liver disease.

we have converted the X-variable Gender into a dummy before starting the analysis.
